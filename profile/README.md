## About WeCan


WeCan is a student-driven initiative at NIT Agartala that started in 2013 with a simple goalâ€”to provide quality education to underprivileged children living near our college campus. Over the years, we have grown into a dedicated team of volunteers, working every day to bring positive change in the lives of these children.  

Education is more than just books and exams; it is the key to a better future. Many of the children we work with come from families who struggle to afford good education. Some of them used to go to school just for the sake of enrollment, without truly learning. WeCan was started to change thisâ€”to make education meaningful, inspiring, and life-changing.  

Our volunteers, who are students themselves, donâ€™t just teach subjects; they also help children understand the importance of learning. We focus on overall development, building confidence, curiosity, and self-motivation, so they can dream big and achieve more.  

At WeCan, we laugh, live, learn, and lead together. We believe in teamwork and the power of collective effort. As our community grows, so does our impact.  

We believe itâ€™s not charityâ€”itâ€™s a responsibility.
